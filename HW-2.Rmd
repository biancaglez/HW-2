## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with:
Brenda, Trisha, and Connor. 
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW so far:
four hours. 
* The URL of the RPubs published URL [here](http://rpubs.com/biancaglez94/218371).
* What gave you the most trouble:
The shiny app inputs and figuring out how to make groups for low, middle, high income to then show in plots (never achieved)
* Any comments you have:
Quizzes should be worth less, homeworks more. 

## Question 1:

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `profiles` data set,
specifically on the relationship between gender and

* `income`
* `job`
* One more categorical variable of your choice

all keeping in mind in HW-3, you will be fitting a logistic regression to
predict a user's gender based on these variables.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4.5}
profiles <- profiles %>% 
  filter(!is.na(diet))

```


To begin exploratory data, let's look at the profile data stored by OKCupid!
Let's exclude the essays in this dataset, assuming these are highly subjective and they're a little too lengthy for an analysis. 

```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

prof_sin <- profiles %>% 
    select(-essay0, -essay1, -essay2, -essay3, -essay4, -essay5, -essay6, -essay7, -essay8, -essay9, -last_online)

kable(head(prof_sin), digits = 1)

```

Mean Age for both Sexes: 

* Dataset fails to include other sex categories, ie transgender, but we will 
continue to perform analysis under binary assumptions. 

```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

#need to answer the question of how many users are male and female to set stage

prof_female <- prof_sin %>% 
  mutate(is_female = ifelse(sex == "f", 1, 0))

#takes mean number of ones, and take percent of females. 
Percent_female <- mean(round(prof_female$is_female)*100)
#must have column name for kable table. 

prof_age <- prof_sin %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(MeanAge = round(mean(age)))   

kable(prof_age, caption = "Mean Age for OkCupid")

```


Age range using a boxplot to explore variation: 
```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
#facet by sex 
#want to have boxplots for both and y axis we want the age range

#clean our dataset 
prof_viz <- prof_sin 
  
ggplot(prof_viz, aes(x = sex, y = age)) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="grey80", colour = "#3366FF") 
  
```


```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
#relationship between income and gender, 
#and gender and job, and gender and body type
job_percent <- prof_sin %>% 
  group_by(job) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(job_tot = n) %>% 
  mutate(job_percent = (job_tot/sum(job_tot)*100)) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
kable()
job_percent


#this isn't printing out for some reason... interesting.... 
```

We cannot ignore -1 category, let's review how often someone reports -1 based on gender:
```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

income <- prof_sin %>% 
filter(income != -1) 

income_1 <- prof_sin %>% 
  filter(income == -1) 
  
income_1 %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  rename(job_amt = n) %>% 
  mutate(
    percent_gender = round(job_amt/sum(job_amt)*100)
  ) %>% 
kable()

```

Median Incomes of Female and Male Profiles
```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

income_median <- income %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(medianIncome = median(income))
kable(income_median)

```

These are our median incomes, but let's look at the variation within this. 
```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

ggplot(income, aes(x = sex, y = income)) +
  geom_jitter(na.rm=TRUE) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="grey80", colour = "darkgreen", alpha = 1/5) 

income_summary <- income %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(sd_income = sd(income), median_income = median(income)) 
kable(income_summary)

```

Over all looks as if the income for males and females is at about the national average. We can question the validity of the data considering it is all self reported. We are also missing -1 values. 

```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

profiles <- income %>% 
  mutate(income_bracket = ifelse(income == -1, "missing", 
                                 ifelse(between(income, 20000, 50000), "low", 
                                        ifelse(between(income, 50001, 100000), "medium", "high"))
                                 ))


#new column with income type, low, midd, and high
ggplot(profiles, aes(x = sex, y = income)) +
  geom_jitter(na.rm=TRUE) +
    geom_boxplot(fill="grey80", colour = "red", alpha = 1/5) +
      facet_wrap(~income_bracket, scales = "free") 

```

Here's a sample of our user's most common jobs:
```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

#relationship between gender and job
job <- prof_sin %>%
  group_by(job, sex) %>% 
  tally () %>% 
  rename(Job_amt = n) 

job_mutate <- job %>% 
  mutate(prop= Job_amt/sum(Job_amt))

job_mutate %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(Job_amt)) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  kable()
```


Same viz, but a bar chart of proportions to better visualize job proportions. We have also included a line showing the percentage of total female profiles to show the disparities between employment type and gender. 
```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
ggplot(job_mutate, aes(x=job, y=prop, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0.4)

#stat identity, stat dodge, fill = sex
#low relative to the gender amount. so ten percent is low relative to the gender female 40% and male 60%
#geom_hline(.4)
#collapse gender and sex

#check out diet 
#science tech engineering 
#include only categorica lvariables that mostly cast the net over all of tots. 

```


Exploring another categorical variable, I am interested in diet variable, but let's see if enough users report these categories and what their frequencies are. 
```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
#categorical variable code

diets <- profiles %>% 
  group_by(diet) %>%  
  tally() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

diets %>% 
slice(1:10) %>% 
  kable()
#how often are these claimed?
#often the categories are other, but let's try to look at two categories:
#anything and vegetarain, we are going to ignore our hillal guys because they are 
#represent a small portion
```


Let's recode these to three similiar categories. About one six of users are vegetarian. Interesting, let's keep digging. 


```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

di_it <- profiles


dre <- di_it%>%
  mutate(diet_code = fct_recode(diet,
                            # New name = old name
                            "omnivore" = "mostly anything",
                            "omnivore" = "anything",
                            "omnivore" = "strictly anything",
                            "omnivore" = "mostly other",
                            "omnivore" = "strictly other",
                            "omnivore" = "other",
                            "veggie" = "mostly vegetarian",
                            "veggie" = "strictly vegetarian",
                            "veggie" = "mostly vegan",
                            "veggie" = "vegetarian",
                            "veggie" = "strictly vegan",
                            "veggie" = "vegan",
                            "other" = "mostly kosher",
                            "other" = "mostly halal",
                            "other" = "strictly kosher",
                            "other" = "strictly halal",
                            "other" = "halal",
                            "other" = "kosher"
  )) 
  
dre_tot <- dre %>% 
  group_by(diet_code) %>% 
  arrange(desc(diet_code)) %>% 
  tally() 

dre_tot %>% 
  kable()


dre_sex <- dre %>% 
  group_by(diet_code, sex) %>% 
  arrange(desc(diet_code)) %>% 
  tally() 

dre_sex %>% 
  kable()

```



Interested in diet proportions, so let's check this baby out to see if diet is valuable predictor.


```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

dre_prop <- dre_sex %>% 
  mutate(
    prop = n/sum(n)
  ) 

dre_prop %>% 
kable()
  
```

These proportions and diet totals make me believe they will be a valuable predictor. For example, you have a 40% chance of being a female in this dataset and 40% chance of being a vegetarian if you are female, too. Let's explore this.

Let's plot test hypothesis:
```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}

ggplot(dre_prop, aes(x=diet_code, y=prop, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0.4) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title ="Diets", x = "Diet Type", y = "Proportion")


```


## Question 2:

In the file `HW-2_Shiny_App.Rmd`, build the Shiny App discussed in Lec09 on
Monday 10/3: Using the `movies` data set in the `ggplot2movies` data set, make a
Shiny app that

* Plots budget on the x-axis and rating on the y-axis
* Instead of having a radio button to select the genre of movie (`Action`,
`Animation`, `Comedy`, etc), have a radio button that allows you to toggle
between comedies and non-comedies. This app should be simpler.
